# Python Learn

This is a repository where I'm learning Python

For the learning process I followed this roadmap: https://roadmap.sh/python

The sctructure is as follows:
1. Basics (including variables, data types, conditionals, loops, exception handling, functions, basic data structures)
2. Data Structures and Algorithms (Arrays, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Heaps, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Tree, Recursion, Sorting)
3. Advenced topics: Modules, Lambdas, Decorators, Iterators, Regular Expressions
4. Object Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Methods, Dunder)
5. Package Managers
6. Frameworks
7. Concurrency
8. Envirnments
9. Static Typing
10. Testing
